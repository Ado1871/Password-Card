# Password-Card

## Introduction

The Password Card Generator is a tool that creates a secure and unique password generation system for individuals concerned with password security and management. The tool generates a card filled with a random assortment of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. Users memorize a pattern instead of a password, and use the pattern to pick characters from the card to form their passwords.

## Features

- Generate a password card with a customizable number of rows.
- Includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Ability to label and save the card with references to the usage (e.g., `A3-youtube.com`).
- Save as Image, HTML and Print.

## Usage

1. **Generate a Password Card:** Run the generator to create a new card. You can specify the number of rows you require. Each card will have columns ranging from A-Z.
   
2. **Memorize a Pattern:** Decide on a pattern that you can easily remember. For example, a pattern might be "start at A3, move right three characters, then down three and then right three."

3. **Derive Passwords:** Use your memorized pattern to pick characters from the card to create your password. For instance, if your pattern starts at A3, and your card has `k` at that position, that's the first character of your password.

4. **Label Your Card:** Save the card reference with a label indicating its use, such as `A3-youtube.com`. This tells you that for youtube.com, your password starts at A4 on your card.
